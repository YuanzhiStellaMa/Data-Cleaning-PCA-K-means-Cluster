# All Code & Step-by-step Annotations for Econometric Research

This is my **first** repository on Github. It contains several useful guidance on how to perform the entire process of data cleaning and modeling for econometrics with Python.

And the first file is about **Basic Dimensionality Reduction** (including methods like **PCA** and **K-means Clustering**, and using the case of penguin data by Prof. Lyon).

The copyright is to **Dr. Spencer Lyon** of his course, Machine Learning for Social Science, from the Graduate School of Arts and Science at **New York University**. So far, all my code in this repository are not only inspired but guided by his lectures and under his instructions. I also appreciate the assisstance provided by **ChatGPT** from OpenAI.

***Wish you and your code all the best!***
