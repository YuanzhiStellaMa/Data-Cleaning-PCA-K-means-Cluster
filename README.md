# All code & step-by-step annotations for basic dimensionality reduction w/ PCA & K-means Clustering: the Case of Penguin data by Prof. Lyon

This is my **first** repository on Github. It contains several useful guidance on how to perform the entire process of data cleaning and modeling for econometrics with Python.

And the first file is about **Basic Dimensionality Reduction** (including methods like **PCA** and **K-means Clustering**).

The copyright is to **Dr. Spencer Lyon**, for so far, all my codes in this repository are not only inspired but guided by his lectures and under his instructions. I also appreciate the assisstance provided by **ChatGPT** from OpenAI.

***Wish you and your code all the best!***
